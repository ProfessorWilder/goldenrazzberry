                <h1>Our Mission Statement:</h1>
                <p>We (I) wish to stop wasting precious resources, watching perfectly good technology stop working--never to be fixed--replacing old technologies and throwing away/never using tools that could help others. I seek to recycle, repair, refurbish, rebuild and reuse old computers and laptops to affect positive change in the world. </p>
                <br><h4>Allow me to explain my story and my plan briefly:</h4>
                <p>After buying a desktop for myself, I brought my old and pretty decent laptop to my girlfriend's (now wife's) house, and was shocked to find it unbootable several days later. I have always had a knack for computers and am employed as an (underpaid) IT technician and (unpaid) webmaster, so I threw it in the corner and told myself I'd figure it out later.</p>
                <p>Cut to later; I am walking home from my wife's house and behind a dumpster I see a 60 gallon plastic tote FILLED with old laptops--so many and in such various states I could never have sat down to assess them all. But I knew I wanted them. Since I could only carry about 6, and many of them had been stripped for RAM and HDs (when a screwdriver was not required), I just filled my backpack with undamaged, unharvested laptops that looked like the newer of them. I wish I'd had a truck and more time.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to this Christmas--I finally made myself a Rufus USB-drive, a Windows recovery USB drive, and got to work checking out all these old laptops. Of the pile, I got enough parts to fix (and add 4GB of extra RAM) the laptop I am currently using (after being broken for a year) and enough parts to rebuild a Samsung NP300E5A for my stepdaughter for Christmas.</p>
                <p>With a growing pile of parts, laptop shells, and other computer parts, I am in a good position to continue taking older, possibly broken lapstops, and refurbish them for students, charity or who knows what else I have yet to think of.</p>
                <p>Finally, the unusable leftovers can have plastics and metals recycled, precious metals extracted, and batteries (et cetera) can be U-Wasted (as required by law.) This is where your donations and my knowledge come together to create less waste, give back to the community, and responsibly dispose of old technologies at no charge to yourself.**</p>

            <p>*I prefer the Latin word "nonnihil" to "aliquid" because "nonnihil" literally means not-nothing, and my inner Latin Poet compels me toward alliteration and repition.</p>
            <p>**Official facts to come, no promises yet--this business plan has yet to come fully to life.</p>
