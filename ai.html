                <p>Here we believe in art, and best of all, published art that can be shared and cherished by people worldwide. Whether visual art or the written word, if you believe that your work represents OUR mission statement, please submit all work through our contact page/forum.</p>
                <h1>Our Mission Statement:</h1>
                <p>More than anything else, we believe in love over hate, and will never tolerate hateful, racist, sexist or any -ist except humanist writing. We believe that the lack of communication between people, especially people of different cultures, is the cause of war and strife worldwide--only though communication and understanding can we build the bridges of peace.</p>
                <p>Our list of published works will begin with my own, and as I am a college student working on my second degree--getting my education degree--to teach English reading and writing, but I am more of an editor than a writer. As we begin collecting works we will first start posting online, then start printing in paper.</p>
                <p>Although we intend to sell physical copies of all completed "books," there will be free PDF versions of all our materials available to all as soon as they are compiled.</p>
