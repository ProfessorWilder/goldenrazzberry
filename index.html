                <p>Welcome--here you will find the personal, business and archival website of Professor Wilder. The first section is a personal project which may one day become a business venture: becoming a small but high-quality publisher of art, poetry, prose and fiction, in all languages for all people--as believers in peace we think that only through communication between all peoples of all cultures can we begin to live together in a peaceful world, and there is no better way to communicate honestly and sincerely than through the various arts we hope to publish.</p>
                <p>The second section of this website is my new, small, personal business idea/side-hustle, which I have named Nonnihil Ex Nihilo Heavy Industries, or N-ex-N Industries for short. In this small business venture I offer IT services in the greater Portland area (for less than the Apple Store or Best Buy), old computer/laptop/technology disposal and recycling (scrapped for usable parts, heavy metals extracted, plastic recycled and remains U-Wasted (in accordance with the law.) Computers/Laptops with the capacity to be repaired and reused will be eiter sold for charity or donated to those in need. See contact page for details about recycling old computers, donating old computers, or applying for a free or discounted computer if you need one!</p>
                <p>Finally, rather than our personal emails or home/office addresses, we have a forum which we encourage you to join for any and all communications with the webmaster/site-lord/one-and-only multitasking self: (me). Soon, when I teach myself more Javascript, PHP and mySQL, getting in contact will be easier--please be patient until then.               </p>
